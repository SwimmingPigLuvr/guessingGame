# Greed ðŸŽ²ðŸŽ² 

cli version of a fun simple dice game

'cargo run' to start

Roll the dice as many times as you want
once you choose to end your turn then your turn score is added to your total score
if you roll a 1 your turn ends and no points are added to your total score
if you roll snake eyes your turn ends and your total score goes to 0
if you roll doubles then those dice are doubled in value
you win by reaching 100

all players get an equal amount of turns
if player 2 reaches 100 in 4 turns, then all following players get one last chance to beat player 2
player 1 does not get to go again because they already had their 4th turn

if you get to 100 or higher you may continue rolling to set a higher score
if the high score is 150, all players have to beat that

GOOD LUCK, HAVE FUN :)
